                  Zoro and Tonoyasu arrive at the town of Ebisu. Although people here
                  are poor, they keep a happy smile every day. Ushimitsu (Witching
                  Hour Boy?) usually shows up and gives money to the impoverished
                  people.They accommodate Zoro with clean water they purchased.
                  “Drink, your tummy won’t hurt.” “Since everyone has a smile the same
                  as Ebisu, it’s called Ebisu Town.” Tonoyasu says. The Big Mom
                  pirates arrive at Wanokuni in the same way and by the same place
                  where Luffy arrived at the Sunny. Yes, Big Mom is in front of them
                  (although now it’s Big Mam). We also see Perospero, Smoothie,
                  Daifuku, Compote, Galette, Basskarte, Flampe or Mont-d’Or among
                  others. No sign of Katakuri or Cracker. Unlike Luffy, Big Mom shoots
                  with cannons at the peaks along the way (Perospero, Smoothie and
                  Daifuku destroy some as well) and lead to giant tents like horses
                  pulling the boat. The Big Mom Pirates arrive at the waterfall and
                  begin to raise it thanks to the tents, Kaido says they must stop it
                  before it goes up. When the boat reaches the top of the waterfall,
                  King in his dinosaur form, attacks the tents (I do not know very
                  well how, we can only see flames in parts of his body). When losing
                  the tents, Big Mom’s boat loses momentum, it can not overcome the
                  waterfall and falls through the waterfall again. We go to Big Mom
                  sinking in the sea while Kaido celebrates with his own the success
                  of King’s attack. In the Flower Capital, Page One is destroying
                  buildings and constructions and is trying to find soba-stand-owner
                  Sangoro. Law says that even if Sanji is caught he must not say
                  anything about the samurais or the Minks. Sanji kicked Page One with
                  considerable force but Page One stands up as if nothing happened.
                  Sanji takes out his Raid Suit and it seems that he is going to use
                  it to fight with Page One.

                  Despite the scarcity of official announcements about the “Haikyuu”
                  season 4 release, many believe that 2019 could be a good year for
                  fans. Meanwhile, there are also speculations that the anime series
                  will return to its original 25-episode run. Fans of the series are
                  entering the two-year mark of not hearing any official news about
                  the launch of “Haikyuu” season 4. But with the franchise’s success
                  as an anime series, many are convinced that it is certainly going to
                  happen. However, some factors are seen contributing to its delay.
                  OtakukArt suggested that “Haikyuu” season 4 could be announced
                  sometime before 2018 ends. But, unfortunately, the anime series is
                  not expected to return until 2019. The same report pointed out that
                  several production members could still be busy with other projects,
                  which is why the making of “Haikyuu” season 4 is still on hold.
                  OtakukArt reported that the anime series’ director, Susumu
                  Mitsunaka, is currently tied to the making of “Layton Mystery
                  Tanteisha: Katori no Nazotoki File.” It is another anime series that
                  just started airing last April and will have a total of 50 episodes.
                  With that, Mitsunaka is speculated to be needing more time before
                  focusing on the production of “Haikyuu” season 4. So, it makes the
                  2019 air date schedule possible. On the other hand, several reports
                  have also been published before claiming that the anime series
                  reached a point where it does not have enough manga chapters as
                  source material. The makers of “Haikyuu” reportedly did not want the
                  anime series to outrun the manga, thus the anime series needed a
                  hiatus before “Haikyuu” season 4 airs while the release of manga
                  chapters continues.

                  Black Clover episode 64 was pretty amazing to behold. In the last
                  episode, we got to see that Asta was still under the control of the
                  Witch Queen. In the most surprising turn of events when it did seem
                  that Asta is going to kill each and every one of his comrades,
                  Vanessa stepped in and saved the day. Vanessa used and controlled
                  her power which is known as the Red Thread of Fate. Black Clover
                  episode 65 Spoilers This amazing power of hers was enough to defeat
                  her mother, the Witch Queen. Vanessa basically saved the lives of
                  everyone around her who otherwise might have ended up dead because
                  of Asta. Unfortunately, the situation is not settled yet but in the
                  upcoming episode, it might well be. Now, coming to the spoilers of
                  the upcoming episode of Black Clover. This episode is titled “I’m
                  Home”. In this episode, we’ll see what is up with Asta. Even though
                  the Witch Queen is dead now, Asta will still be battling inside his
                  head with Witch Queen’s control. From the preview, it seems that
                  Asta is surrounded by veins and everything and is inside a blood
                  ball or something. Asta might be even given some new kind of
                  powerful power-up to deal with this situation.The Black Clover
