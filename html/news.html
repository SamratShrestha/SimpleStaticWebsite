        <h1>Imaginator Returns</h1>
        <p>
          This episode represents a major breakthrough for the Imaginator side
          of our conflict. By the end, Spooky E is toast, and I imagine the Towa
          Organization's mysterious goals die with him for now. We also learn
          some important things about the differences in the ways that the
          Imaginator and Spooky E take control of people. It feels like this "VS
          Imaginator" storyline is tumbling toward its conclusion, but we're not
          quite there yet. Still, everyone is now in place for a final
          confrontation between the Imaginator and Boogiepop.We focus heavily
          this week on Jin, so it makes sense that the episode starts with him
          narrating. We're quickly interrupted by Suema observing one of the
          girls he's enlisted on the phone with him, noticing that she seems
          suspicious.

        <h1>Dragon Ball Super</h1>
        <p>
          Dragon Ball Super: Broly opened on January 23 in the UK and Ireland,
          while an early London "Fan Screening" on January 15 sold out in 23
          seconds. Manga Entertainment described the film as the biggest it has
          released, with the promotion handled completely in-house by Manga's
          marketing team. The promotion included digital outdoor advertising
          (pictured above) which ran in London last weekend to promote the IMAX
          screenings of the film. The film opened in Japan on December 14.
          Original manga creator Akira Toriyama provided a comment for the film:
          Everyone, do you know who Broly is? He appeared only in past anime
          films, and is a ridiculously strong Saiyan. I am told I only drew his
          design; at that time I was mostly uninvolved with the anime, and so I
          completely forgot the details.
