        <h1>After the rain</h1>
        <p>
          As Akira tries her hardest to forge a relationship (preferably
          romantic) with her boss, both she and Kondo find themselves facing
          their changing realities. Akira's (former?) best friend Haruka feels
          as if Akira has set up a barrier between them following her surgery,
          while Kondo faces the fact that he may in fact have allowed jealousy
          over his college friend's literary success to separate the two. Will
          making their own relationship work help Kondo and Akira to fix other
          aspects of their lives? Some of the most powerful, significant moments
          in the second omnibus of Jun Mayuzuki's After the Rain (containing
          volumes three and four of the series) are those without words. While
          Mayuzuki's art is at times stylized to the point where Akira looks a
          little misshapen, or at least like she's been through a taffy pull,
          Mayuzuki gets great poignancy and heft out of scenes where she never
          speaks but instead allows her feelings to carry her story.

            out her emotions about both Kondo, the forty-five-year-old she's
            infatuated with, and Haruka, her best friend.

        <h1>Hunter X Hunter</h1>
        <p>
          Years ago, the Hunter Association harbored a dark counterpart, an
          organization of Shadows that completed the missions too dubious to
          stain the hands of the association itself. Though it has been years
          since this organization was disbanded, the ashes of resentment still
          linger, and now a new group of foes are determined to bring the
          Hunters' past crimes to light. In the towering peaks of Heaven's
          Arena, Gon and his friends will cross blows with these enemies, in a
          battle that threatens all of the Hunter's Association. But who are
          these mysterious enemies, and what is their strange power that seems
          to eclipse even Nen?I can't say I envy the writers of tie-in films for
          continuing manga adaptations. Their task generally implies threading a
          needle through a hole that may not even exist, balancing the
          audience's desire for meaningful, consequential drama with the fact
          that nothing in their film can fundamentally alter the manga's
          narrative variables<a class="read-more-show hide" href="#"

            “At the end of the day, all of these characters must be reset to
            where they started” is a difficult constraint to work around, doubly
            so when it comes to Hunter x Hunter. One of Hunter x Hunter's
            signature qualities could be considered “actions have real
            consequences” - major characters are maimed or killed, victories are
            never easy, and all central characters are written such that you can
            feel the weight of their past choices in their future steps.

        <h1>Kingdom Hearts III</h1>
        <p>
          Your impressions of Kingdom Hearts III are almost entirely shaped by
          how much experience you've had with the series thus far. Or how you
          felt about each entry. Zipping around Disney, Pixar and original
          Kingdom Hearts worlds, Sora seeks to find a resolution to seven
          previous titles worth of character stories to finally conclude the
          saga. Overall, it's a stunning accomplishment.Resolutions form the
          core of Kingdom Hearts III, not just in regards to the combat, but
          within the gameplay as well, forming a game filled with references to
          previous titles. As I said before, how you value these references will
          determine whether this is a game where characters finally learn to
          recognise their own self-worth, or if it's a game about travelling
          through Disney properties, occasionally interrupted with some nonsense
          about “hearts” and “darkness”.

            I don't think it's unfair to say that Kingdom Hearts III is exactly
            the game that fans expected it to be. Instead of introducing a new
            unexpected story, the game follows directly after the events of
            Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance where Sora has just been made
            aware of Xehanort's new plans. It's possibly the quickest entry into
            a Kingdom Hearts title yet, setting aside the menial tasks of the
            previous two numbered entries' opening moments and sending you
            straight into the familiar Disney world of Hercules. Whilst the
            stated theme of Kingdom Hearts III is “resolutions”, I can't help
            but rephrase that to “finding happiness”. Everything from the
            character writing (which either through the original script or
            localisation, has improved massively) to the bright new visuals
            emphasises absolute joy
